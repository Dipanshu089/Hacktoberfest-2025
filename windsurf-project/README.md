# Smart Traffic Insights for Indian Cities - Indore Implementation

## 🚦 Project Overview

This project implements a mini AI-powered system that provides traffic insights for Indian cities, specifically designed for Indore. The system helps citizens, delivery services, and city officials gain insights into traffic patterns and improve mobility.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an AI-powered traffic prediction system
- Provide real-time traffic insights for major roads in Indore
- Help optimize routes and reduce congestion
- Support decision-making for citizens and city officials

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Interactive Web Dashboard)
- **Backend**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Folium Maps
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy

## 📊 Features

### 1. Real-time Traffic Dashboard
- Interactive traffic volume monitoring
- Congestion level indicators
- Average speed tracking
- Road-wise traffic analysis

### 2. AI-Powered Traffic Prediction

## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow

**Data → Processing → Model → Output**

1. **Data Collection**: Generate/collect traffic data from various sources
2. **Data Processing**: Clean, transform, and feature engineering
3. **Model Training**: Train Random Forest model for traffic prediction
4. **Output Generation**: Real-time predictions and visualizations

## 🏙️ Implementation for Indore

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Month 1-2)
- Install IoT sensors at major intersections
- Integrate with existing traffic cameras
- Set up data collection from GPS devices
- Focus on major roads: MG Road, AB Road, Agra-Mumbai Highway

### Phase 2: System Development (Month 3-4)
- Deploy ML models for real-time prediction
- Develop mobile app for citizens
- Create dashboard for traffic officials
- Integrate with existing city infrastructure

### Phase 3: Integration (Month 5-6)
- Connect with traffic signal systems
- Integrate with Google Maps/navigation apps
- Launch public awareness campaigns
- Train city officials on system usage

## 📈 Expected Benefits

- **25%** reduction in average commute time
- **30%** improvement in fuel efficiency
- **40%** better traffic flow management
- Real-time alerts for citizens and delivery services
- Data-driven traffic management decisions

## 🎯 Target Users

1. **Citizens**: Route planning and travel time optimization
2. **Delivery Services**: Efficient route planning and time estimation
3. **City Officials**: Traffic management and infrastructure planning
4. **Urban Planners**: Data-driven city development decisions

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked

- Traffic Volume (vehicles/hour)
- Average Speed (km/h)
- Congestion Levels (Low/Medium/High)
- Peak Hour Patterns
- Weekend vs Weekday Variations

## 🔮 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Features**: Hour patterns, day of week, weekend indicator
- **Accuracy**: R² score displayed in real-time
- **Prediction**: Traffic volume and congestion levels
