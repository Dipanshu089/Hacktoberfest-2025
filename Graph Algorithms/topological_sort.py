Topological Sort Implementation

Topological Sort (Topo Sort) is a linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this ordering, for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before vertex v.

Key Properties:
- Works only for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Cannot have cycles - if the graph has a cycle, topological sorting is not possible
- Multiple valid orders may exist for the same graph

Applications:
- Task scheduling (e.g., course prerequisites, build systems)
- Dependency resolution
- Job scheduling with dependencies

This module implements two approaches:
1. DFS-based approach: Uses depth-first search with a stack
2. Kahn's Algorithm: BFS-based approach using in-degree calculation
